# Math-Related-Projects-XOJO

A lot of these projects are in French. It is code though so... doesn't really matter.
Language: REALbasic  
IDE: Xojo https://www.xojo.com/download/    

These projects are pretty similar to the ones in my Function-Library-XOJO repository.  

It contains (other than what is in the Function-Library-XOJO repository):   
  - Base conversion calculator (Binary to decimal, etc)  
  - Cubic and quadratic solutions calculator   
  - System of equations up to 3 variables solutions calculator   
  - Prime number generator   
  - Vector manipulation  
  - A huge project with a bunch of mathematical sequence generators (*__SuiteMATHEMATIQUE.xojo_binary_project__*)
  
What I learnt:  
  - Too much math   
  - More  math     
  - Data Structures    
  - Algorithms
